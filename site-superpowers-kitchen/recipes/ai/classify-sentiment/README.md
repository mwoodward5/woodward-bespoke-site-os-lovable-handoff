# Classify Sentiment

**Category:** `ai`  **Perf tier:** cheap  **Cost tier:** cheap  **Depends on Lovable Cloud:** yes

## What it does
AI capability. Runs server-side against Lovable AI Gateway. Never leaks the key to the client.

## Files
- `README.md` — this file
- `component.tsx` — React drop-in (client)
- `functions.ts` — `createServerFn` implementation (server, if applicable)
- `route.ts` — server route (HTTP endpoint, if applicable)
- `snippet.html` — vanilla fallback where feasible
- `env.example` — required environment variables
- `sql.sql` — DB migration if the recipe needs a table (GRANTs + RLS included)
- `variants.md` — tuning knobs
- `preview.png` — 1200×750 poster

## Natural-language triggers
- "add a classify sentiment"
- "give me a classify sentiment"
- "wire up a classify sentiment"
- "build a classify sentiment"
- "classify sentiment"
- "classify sentiment on the site"

## Wiring
1. Copy this folder into your project (or import via the kitchen index).
2. Copy any env vars from `env.example` into your project's secrets (Lovable Cloud handles this).
3. If `sql.sql` exists, run it as a migration.
4. Import `<component.tsx>` and drop it into a route, or wire the server fn from `functions.ts`.

## Refuse when
- The user is on a regulated surface without an audited pipeline (healthcare PHI, financial filings, government forms) — swap the LLM for a rules engine.
- The recipe is `voice` or `realtime` and the target audience needs a fully static fallback.
- The recipe emits user-generated content and moderation is not wired.
